 <h5>About Page</h5>
<p>My name is Rachel, and I am from Florida. I have grown up around classic trucks/cars all my life. Started learning about how vehicles worked when I was 8 years old. First thing I ever worked on was my Dad’s 1969 F-100. I am a huge fan of the classic vehicles and I know it can be struggle to keep up with all the classical cars out there much less car parts. I wanted to create a platform where the old souls can come together to help each other out in learning about classic cars or fixing them up. Hoping to inspire some people to get into the classic side of things.</p>

 p>Technical Specifications</p>
 <p>Some of the specifications for my application will include, vehicle weight, length, height, track width, and weight distributions. This application will be used all over the world therefore, the user will need to input location, date, and time. Most of the application will be automated. The user will be required to choose the country they live in. This application will be a mobile application which makes it different from a desktop application. The input device will be the screen. Communication hardware is required for this application as well. The user will have access to GPS and Internet if they so choose.</p> 
<p>The Introduction</p>
<p>“The Classics” is a mobile application that gives anyone around the world an opportunity to find classic car/truck parts between 1900-2000. The user is in control. They can put up any classic car part for sale or they can give advice to help other people with the same interests as them. In fact, you don’t have to sell anything, you could be on there to talk to other people with the same classic vehicle interests. This will be a friendly platform to keep the older traditions alive. You can access this anywhere in the world as long as you have a smartphone. It will be accessible on iOS and Android devices.</p>
<p>How to Use</p>
<p>When you download the app, it will prompt you to make an account. You can choose to make an account or just to access it as a guest. Of course, if you make an account, you will be able to save your liked/interested data. If you choose to sign up, it will ask you for your email/phone number, and your first and last name. You can opt out of email updates if you wish. It will prompt you to choose what country you live in and the rest is automated. It will show you car parts near you depending on what you set your distance at. Not only can you see/sell car parts, but you also have the option to chat with other people who show the same interest and possibly meet up locally. It keeps the classic car people together along with potentially making friends with people who share the same interests as you.</p> 
<p>General Safety Knowledge</p>
<p>Since this is an application that would have your location (if you enabled it), you would want to be careful who you share it with. The little information you do enter, will be kept in storage component within the application. It will have a RAM backup but if you choose to delete the account and application later, your data will be erased as soon as you delete it completely. No one will have access to your personal information without your consent. We may keep it in a storage component but will not be accessed ever. This is a small breakdown of my application and how it will work.</p>
